Hare.\r\nTRANSLATOR'S PREFACE\r\nThe object of a translator should ever be to hold the mirror upto his author. That being so, his chief duty is to represent so far as\r\npracticable the manner in which his author's ideas have been expressed, retaining if possible at the sacrifice of idiom and taste \r\nall the peculiarities of his author's imagery and of language as well. In regard to translations from the Sanskrit, nothing is easier \r\nthan to dish up Hindu ideas, so as to make them agreeable to English taste. But the endeavour of the present translator has been \r\nto give in the following pages as literal a rendering as possible of the great work of Vyasa. To the purely English reader there is \r\nmuch in the following pages that will strike as ridiculous. Those unacquainted with any language but their own are generally \r\nvery exclusive in matters of taste. Having no knowledge of models other than what they meet with in their own tongue, the \r\nstandard they have formed of purity and taste in composition must necessarily be a narrow one. The translator, however, would \r\nill-discharge his duty, if for the sake of avoiding ridicule, he sacrificed fidelity to the original. He must represent his author as \r\nhe is, not as he should be to please the narrow taste of those entirely unacquainted with him. Mr. Pickford, in the preface to his \r\nEnglish translation of the Mahavira Charita, ably defends a close adherence to the original even at the sacrifice of idiom and \r\ntaste against the claims of what has been called 'Free Translation,' which means dressing the author in an outlandish garb to \r\nplease those to whom he is introduced.\r\nIn the preface to his classical translation of Bhartrihari's Niti Satakam and Vairagya Satakam, Mr. C.H. Tawney says, \"I am \r\nsensible that in the present attempt I have retained much local colouring. For instance, the ideas of worshipping the feet of a \r\ngod of great men, though it frequently occurs in Indian literature, will undoubtedly move the laughter of Englishmen \r\nunacquainted with Sanskrit, especially if they happen to belong to that class of readers who revel their attention on the\r\naccidental and remain blind to the essential. But a certain measure of fidelity to the original even at the risk of making oneself \r\nridiculous, is better than the studied dishonesty which characterises so many translations of oriental poets.\"\r\nWe fully subscribe to the above although, it must be observed, the censure conveyed to the class of translators last indicated is \r\nrather undeserved, there being nothing like a 'studied dishonesty' in their efforts which proceed only from a mistaken view of \r\ntheir duties and as such betray only an error of the head but not of the heart. More than twelve years ago when Babu Pratapa \r\nChandra Roy, with Babu Durga Charan Banerjee, went to my retreat at Seebpore, for engaging me to translate the Mahabharata \r\ninto English, I was amazed with the grandeur of the scheme. My first question to him was,--whence was the money to come,\r\nsupposing my competence for the task. Pratapa then unfolded to me the details of his plan, the hopes he could legitimately \r\ncherish of assistance from different quarters. He was full of enthusiasm. He showed me Dr. Rost's letter, which, he said, had \r\nsuggested to him the undertaking. I had known Babu Durga Charan for many years and I had the highest opinion of his \r\nscholarship and practical good sense. When he warmly took Pratapa's side for convincing me of the practicability of the\r\nscheme, I listened to him patiently. The two were for completing all arrangements with me the very day. To this I did not \r\nagree. I took a week's time to consider. I consulted some of my literary friends, foremost among whom was the late lamented \r\nDr. Sambhu C. Mookherjee. The latter, I found, had been waited upon by Pratapa. Dr. Mookherjee spoke to me of Pratapa as a \r\nman of indomitable energy and perseverance. The result of my conference with Dr. Mookherjee was that I wrote to Pratapa \r\nasking him to see me again. In this second interview estimates were drawn up, and everything was arranged as far as my \r\nportion of the work was concerned. My friend left with me a specimen of translation which he had received from Professor \r\nMax Muller. This I began to study, carefully comparing it sentence by sentence with the original. About its literal character \r\nthere could be no doubt, but it had no flow and, therefore, could not be perused with pleasure by the general reader. The \r\ntranslation had been executed thirty years ago by a young German friend of the great Pundit. I had to touch up every sentence. \r\nThis I did without at all impairing faithfulness to the original. My first 'copy' was set up in type and a dozen sheets were struck",

        "content": "off. These were submitted to the judgment of a number of eminent writers, European and native. All of them, I was glad to see, \r\napproved of the specimen, and then the task of translating the Mahabharata into English seriously began.\r\nBefore, however, the first fasciculus could be issued, the question as to whether the authorship of the translation should be \r\npublicly owned, arose. Babu Pratapa Chandra Roy was against anonymity. I was for it. The reasons I adduced were chiefly \r\nfounded upon the impossibility of one person translating the whole of the gigantic work. Notwithstanding my resolve to \r\ndischarge to the fullest extent the duty that I took up, I might not live to carry it out. It would take many years before the end\r\ncould be reached. Other circumstances than death might arise in consequence of which my connection with the work might \r\ncease. It could not be desirable to issue successive fasciculus with the names of a succession of translators appearing on the \r\ntitle pages. These and other considerations convinced my friend that, after all, my view was correct. It was, accordingly, \r\nresolved to withhold the name of the translator. As a compromise, however, between the two views, it was resolved to issue the \r\nfirst fasciculus with two prefaces, one over the signature of the publisher and the other headed--'Translator's Preface.' This, it \r\nwas supposed, would effectually guard against misconceptions of every kind. No careful reader would then confound the \r\npublisher with the author.\r\nAlthough this plan was adopted, yet before a fourth of the task had been accomplished, an influential Indian journal came down \r\nupon poor Pratapa Chandra Roy and accused him openly of being a party to a great literary imposture, viz., of posing before \r\nthe world as the translator of Vyasa's work when, in fact, he was only the publisher. The charge came upon my friend as a \r\nsurprise, especially as he had never made a secret of the authorship in his correspondence with Oriental scholars in every part \r\nof the world. He promptly wrote to the journal in question, explaining the reasons there were for anonymity, and pointing to the \r\ntwo prefaces with which the first fasciculus had been given to the world. The editor readily admitted his mistake and made a \r\nsatisfactory apology.\r\nNow that the translation has been completed, there can no longer be any reason for withholding the name of the translator. The \r\nentire translation is practically the work of one hand. In portions of the Adi and the Sabha Parvas, I was assisted by Babu \r\nCharu Charan Mookerjee. About four forms of the Sabha Parva were done by Professor Krishna Kamal Bhattacharya, and\r\nabout half a fasciculus during my illness, was done by another hand. I should however state that before passing to the printer \r\nthe copy received from these gentlemen I carefully compared every sentence with the original, making such alterations as were \r\nneeded for securing a uniformity of style with the rest of the work.\r\nI should here observe that in rendering the Mahabharata into English I have derived very little aid from the three Bengali \r\nversions that are supposed to have been executed with care. Every one of these is full of inaccuracies and blunders of every \r\ndescription. The Santi in particular which is by far the most difficult of the eighteen Parvas, has been made a mess of by the \r\nPundits that attacked it. Hundreds of ridiculous blunders can be pointed out in both the Rajadharma and the Mokshadharma\r\nsections. Some of these I have pointed out in footnotes.\r\nI cannot lay claim to infallibility. There are verses in the Mahabharata that are exceedingly difficult to construe. I have derived \r\nmuch aid from the great commentator Nilakantha. I know that Nilakantha's authority is not incapable of being challenged. But \r\nwhen it is remembered that the interpretations given by Nilakantha came down to him from preceptors of olden days, one \r\nshould think twice before rejecting Nilakantha as a guide.\r\nAbout the readings I have adopted, I should say that as regards the first half of the work, I have generally adhered to the Bengal \r\ntexts; as regards the latter half, to the printed Bombay edition. Sometimes individual sections, as occurring in the Bengal \r\neditions, differ widely, in respect of the order of the verses, from the corresponding ones in the Bombay edition. In such cases I \r\nhave adhered to the Bengal texts, convinced that the sequence of ideas has been better preserved in the Bengal editions than the \r\nBombay one.\r\nI should express my particular obligations to Pundit Ram Nath Tarkaratna, the author of 'Vasudeva Vijayam' and other poems, \r\nPundit Shyama Charan Kaviratna, the learned editor of Kavyaprakasha with the commentary of Professor Mahesh Chandra \r\nNayaratna, and Babu Aghore Nath Banerjee, the manager of the Bharata Karyalaya. All these scholars were my referees on all \r\npoints of difficulty. Pundit Ram Nath's solid scholarship is known to them that have come in contact with him. I never referred \r\nto him a difficulty that he could not clear up. Unfortunately, he was not always at hand to consult. Pundit Shyama Charan \r\nKaviratna, during my residence at Seebpore, assisted me in going over the Mokshadharma sections of the Santi Parva. \r\nUnostentatious in the extreme, Kaviratna is truly the type of a learned Brahman of ancient India. Babu Aghore Nath Banerjee \r\nalso has from time to time, rendered me valuable assistance in clearing my difficulties.\r\nGigantic as the work is, it would have been exceedingly difficult for me to go on with it if I had not been encouraged by Sir \r\nStuart Bayley, Sir Auckland Colvin, Sir Alfred Croft, and among Oriental scholars, by the late lamented Dr. Reinhold Rost, \r\nand Mons. A. Barth of Paris. All these eminent men know from the beginning that the translation was proceeding from my pen. \r\nNotwithstanding the enthusiasm, with which my poor friend, Pratapa Chandra Roy, always endeavoured to fill me. I am sure \r\nmy energies would have flagged and patience exhausted but for the encouraging words which I always received from these \r\npatrons and friends of the enterprise.",

        "content": "Lastly, I should name my literary chief and friend, Dr. Sambhu C. Mookherjee. The kind interest he took in my labours, the \r\nrepeated exhortations he addressed to me inculcating patience, the care with which he read every fasciculus as it came out, \r\nmarking all those passages which threw light upon topics of antiquarian interest, and the words of praise he uttered when any \r\nexpression particularly happy met his eyes, served to stimulate me more than anything else in going on with a task that\r\nsometimes seemed to me endless.\r\nKisari Mohan Ganguli\r\nCalcutta\r\nTHE MAHABHARATA\r\nADI PARVA\r\nSECTION I\r\nOm! Having bowed down to Narayana and Nara, the most exalted male being, and also to the goddess Saraswati, must the \r\nword Jaya be uttered.\r\nUgrasrava, the son of Lomaharshana, surnamed Sauti, well-versed in the Puranas, bending with humility, one day approached \r\nthe great sages of rigid vows, sitting at their ease, who had attended the twelve years' sacrifice of Saunaka, surnamed Kulapati, \r\nin the forest of Naimisha. Those ascetics, wishing to hear his wonderful narrations, presently began to address him who had \r\nthus arrived at that recluse abode of the inhabitants of the forest of Naimisha. Having been entertained with due respect by \r\nthose holy men, he saluted those Munis (sages) with joined palms, even all of them, and inquired about the progress of their \r\nasceticism. Then all the ascetics being again seated, the son of Lomaharshana humbly occupied the seat that was assigned to \r\nhim. Seeing that he was comfortably seated, and recovered from fatigue, one of the Rishis beginning the conversation, asked \r\nhim, 'Whence comest thou, O lotus-eyed Sauti, and where hast thou spent the time? Tell me, who ask thee, in detail.'\r\nAccomplished in speech, Sauti, thus questioned, gave in the midst of that big assemblage of contemplative Munis a full and \r\nproper answer in words consonant with their mode of life.\r\n\"Sauti said, 'Having heard the diverse sacred and wonderful stories which were composed in his Mahabharata by Krishna\u0002Dwaipayana, and which were recited in full by Vaisampayana at the Snake-sacrifice of the high-souled royal sage Janamejaya \r\nand in the presence also of that chief of Princes, the son of Parikshit, and having wandered about, visiting many sacred waters \r\nand holy shrines, I journeyed to the country venerated by the Dwijas (twice-born) and called Samantapanchaka where formerly \r\nwas fought the battle between the children of Kuru and Pandu, and all the chiefs of the land ranged on either side. Thence, \r\nanxious to see you, I am come into your presence. Ye reverend sages, all of whom are to me as Brahma; ye greatly blessed who \r\nshine in this place of sacrifice with the splendour of the solar fire: ye who have concluded the silent meditations and have fed \r\nthe holy fire; and yet who are sitting--without care, what, O ye Dwijas (twice-born), shall I repeat, shall I recount the sacred\r\nstories collected in the Puranas containing precepts of religious duty and of worldly profit, or the acts of illustrious saints and \r\nsovereigns of mankind?\"\r\n\"The Rishi replied, 'The Purana, first promulgated by the great Rishi Dwaipayana, and which after having been heard both by \r\nthe gods and the Brahmarshis was highly esteemed, being the most eminent narrative that exists, diversified both in diction and \r\ndivision, possessing subtile meanings logically combined, and gleaned from the Vedas, is a sacred work. Composed in elegant \r\nlanguage, it includeth the subjects of other books. It is elucidated by other Shastras, and comprehendeth the sense of the four \r\nVedas. We are desirous of hearing that history also called Bharata, the holy composition of the wonderful Vyasa, which \r\ndispelleth the fear of evil, just as it was cheerfully recited by the Rishi Vaisampayana, under the direction of Dwaipayana \r\nhimself, at the snake-sacrifice of Raja Janamejaya?'\r\n\"Sauti then said, 'Having bowed down to the primordial being Isana, to whom multitudes make offerings, and who is adored by \r\nthe multitude; who is the true incorruptible one, Brahma, perceptible, imperceptible, eternal; who is both a non-existing and an \r\nexisting-non-existing being; who is the universe and also distinct from the existing and non-existing universe; who is the \r\ncreator of high and low; the ancient, exalted, inexhaustible one; who is Vishnu, beneficent and the beneficence itself, worthy of \r\nall preference, pure and immaculate; who is Hari, the ruler of the faculties, the guide of all things moveable and immoveable; I \r\nwill declare the sacred thoughts of the illustrious sage Vyasa, of marvelous deeds and worshipped here by all. Some bards have \r\nalready published this history, some are now teaching it, and others, in like manner, will hereafter promulgate it upon the earth. \r\nIt is a great source of knowledge, established throughout the three regions of the world. It is possessed by the twice-born both \r\nin detailed and compendious forms. It is the delight of the learned for being embellished with elegant expressions, \r\nconversations human and divine, and a variety of poetical measures.\r\nIn this world, when it was destitute of brightness and light, and enveloped all around in total darkness, there came into being, as \r\nthe primal cause of creation, a mighty egg, the one inexhaustible seed of all created beings. It is called Mahadivya, and was",

        "content": "formed at the beginning of the Yuga, in which we are told, was the true light Brahma, the eternal one, the wonderful and \r\ninconceivable being present alike in all places; the invisible and subtile cause, whose nature partaketh of entity and non-entity. \r\nFrom this egg came out the lord Pitamaha Brahma, the one only Prajapati; with Suraguru and Sthanu. Then appeared the \r\ntwenty-one Prajapatis, viz., Manu, Vasishtha and Parameshthi; ten Prachetas, Daksha, and the seven sons of Daksha. Then \r\nappeared the man of inconceivable nature whom all the Rishis know and so the Viswe-devas, the Adityas, the Vasus, and the \r\ntwin Aswins; the Yakshas, the Sadhyas, the Pisachas, the Guhyakas, and the Pitris. After these were produced the wise and \r\nmost holy Brahmarshis, and the numerous Rajarshis distinguished by every noble quality. So the water, the heavens, the earth, \r\nthe air, the sky, the points of the heavens, the years, the seasons, the months, the fortnights, called Pakshas, with day and night \r\nin due succession. And thus were produced all things which are known to mankind.\r\nAnd what is seen in the universe, whether animate or inanimate, of created things, will at the end of the world, and after the \r\nexpiration of the Yuga, be again confounded. And, at the commencement of other Yugas, all things will be renovated, and, like \r\nthe various fruits of the earth, succeed each other in the due order of their seasons. Thus continueth perpetually to revolve in \r\nthe world, without beginning and without end, this wheel which causeth the destruction of all things.\r\nThe generation of Devas, in brief, was thirty-three thousand, thirty-three hundred and thirty-three. The sons of Div were \r\nBrihadbhanu, Chakshus, Atma Vibhavasu, Savita, Richika, Arka, Bhanu, Asavaha, and Ravi. Of these Vivaswans of old, \r\nMahya was the youngest whose son was Deva-vrata. The latter had for his son, Su-vrata who, we learn, had three sons,--Dasa\u0002jyoti, Sata-jyoti, and Sahasra-jyoti, each of them producing numerous offspring. The illustrious Dasa-jyoti had ten thousand,\r\nSata-jyoti ten times that number, and Sahasra-jyoti ten times the number of Sata-jyoti's offspring. From these are descended the \r\nfamily of the Kurus, of the Yadus, and of Bharata; the family of Yayati and of Ikshwaku; also of all the Rajarshis. Numerous \r\nalso were the generations produced, and very abundant were the creatures and their places of abode. The mystery which is \r\nthreefold--the Vedas, Yoga, and Vijnana Dharma, Artha, and Kama--also various books upon the subject of Dharma, Artha,\r\nand Kama; also rules for the conduct of mankind; also histories and discourses with various srutis; all of which having been \r\nseen by the Rishi Vyasa are here in due order mentioned as a specimen of the book.\r\nThe Rishi Vyasa published this mass of knowledge in both a detailed and an abridged form. It is the wish of the learned in the \r\nworld to possess the details and the abridgement. Some read the Bharata beginning with the initial mantra (invocation), others \r\nwith the story of Astika, others with Uparichara, while some Brahmanas study the whole. Men of learning display their various \r\nknowledge of the institutes in commenting on the composition. Some are skilful in explaining it, while others, in remembering \r\nits contents.\r\nThe son of Satyavati having, by penance and meditation, analysed the eternal Veda, afterwards composed this holy history, \r\nwhen that learned Brahmarshi of strict vows, the noble Dwaipayana Vyasa, offspring of Parasara, had finished this greatest of \r\nnarrations, he began to consider how he might teach it to his disciples. And the possessor of the six attributes, Brahma, the \r\nworld's preceptor, knowing of the anxiety of the Rishi Dwaipayana, came in person to the place where the latter was, for\r\ngratifying the saint, and benefiting the people. And when Vyasa, surrounded by all the tribes of Munis, saw him, he was \r\nsurprised; and, standing with joined palms, he bowed and ordered a seat to be brought. And Vyasa having gone round him who \r\nis called Hiranyagarbha seated on that distinguished seat stood near it; and being commanded by Brahma Parameshthi, he sat \r\ndown near the seat, full of affection and smiling in joy. Then the greatly glorious Vyasa, addressing Brahma Parameshthi, said, \r\n\"O divine Brahma, by me a poem hath been composed which is greatly respected. The mystery of the Veda, and what other \r\nsubjects have been explained by me; the various rituals of the Upanishads with the Angas; the compilation of the Puranas and \r\nhistory formed by me and named after the three divisions of time, past, present, and future; the determination of the nature of \r\ndecay, fear, disease, existence, and non-existence, a description of creeds and of the various modes of life; rule for the four\r\ncastes, and the import of all the Puranas; an account of asceticism and of the duties of a religious student; the dimensions of the \r\nsun and moon, the planets, constellations, and stars, together with the duration of the four ages; the Rik, Sama and Yajur \r\nVedas; also the Adhyatma; the sciences called Nyaya, Orthoephy and Treatment of diseases; charity and Pasupatadharma; birth \r\ncelestial and human, for particular purposes; also a description of places of pilgrimage and other holy places of rivers,\r\nmountains, forests, the ocean, of heavenly cities and the kalpas; the art of war; the different kinds of nations and languages: the \r\nnature of the manners of the people; and the all-pervading spirit;--all these have been represented. But, after all, no writer of \r\nthis work is to be found on earth.'\r\n\"Brahma said. 'I esteem thee for thy knowledge of divine mysteries, before the whole body of celebrated Munis distinguished \r\nfor the sanctity of their lives. I know thou hast revealed the divine word, even from its first utterance, in the language of truth. \r\nThou hast called thy present work a poem, wherefore it shall be a poem. There shall be no poets whose works may equal the \r\ndescriptions of this poem, even, as the three other modes called Asrama are ever unequal in merit to the domestic Asrama. Let\r\nGanesa be thought of, O Muni, for the purpose of writing the poem.'\r\n\"Sauti said, 'Brahma having thus spoken to Vyasa, retired to his own abode. Then Vyasa began to call to mind Ganesa. And \r\nGanesa, obviator of obstacles, ready to fulfil the desires of his votaries, was no sooner thought of, than he repaired to the place \r\nwhere Vyasa was seated. And when he had been saluted, and was seated, Vyasa addressed him thus, 'O guide of the Ganas! be \r\nthou the writer of the Bharata which I have formed in my imagination, and which I am about to repeat.\"",

        "content": "\"Ganesa, upon hearing this address, thus answered, 'I will become the writer of thy work, provided my pen do not for a \r\nmoment cease writing.\" And Vyasa said unto that divinity, 'Wherever there be anything thou dost not comprehend, cease to \r\ncontinue writing.' Ganesa having signified his assent, by repeating the word Om! proceeded to write; and Vyasa began; and by \r\nway of diversion, he knit the knots of composition exceeding close; by doing which, he dictated this work according to his \r\nengagement.\r\nI am (continued Sauti) acquainted with eight thousand and eight hundred verses, and so is Suka, and perhaps Sanjaya. From the \r\nmysteriousness of their meaning, O Muni, no one is able, to this day, to penetrate those closely knit difficult slokas. Even the \r\nomniscient Ganesa took a moment to consider; while Vyasa, however, continued to compose other verses in great abundance.\r\nThe wisdom of this work, like unto an instrument of applying collyrium, hath opened the eyes of the inquisitive world blinded \r\nby the darkness of ignorance. As the sun dispelleth the darkness, so doth the Bharata by its discourses on religion, profit, \r\npleasure and final release, dispel the ignorance of men. As the full-moon by its mild light expandeth the buds of the water-lily, \r\nso this Purana, by exposing the light of the Sruti hath expanded the human intellect. By the lamp of history, which destroyeth \r\nthe darkness of ignorance, the whole mansion of nature is properly and completely illuminated.\r\nThis work is a tree, of which the chapter of contents is the seed; the divisions called Pauloma and Astika are the root; the part \r\ncalled Sambhava is the trunk; the books called Sabha and Aranya are the roosting perches; the books called Arani is the \r\nknitting knots; the books called Virata and Udyoga the pith; the book named Bhishma, the main branch; the book called Drona, \r\nthe leaves; the book called Karna, the fair flowers; the book named Salya, their sweet smell; the books entitled Stri and\r\nAishika, the refreshing shade; the book called Santi, the mighty fruit; the book called Aswamedha, the immortal sap; the \r\ndenominated Asramavasika, the spot where it groweth; and the book called Mausala, is an epitome of the Vedas and held in \r\ngreat respect by the virtuous Brahmanas. The tree of the Bharata, inexhaustible to mankind as the clouds, shall be as a source \r\nof livelihood to all distinguished poets.\"\r\n\"Sauti continued, 'I will now speak of the undying flowery and fruitful productions of this tree, possessed of pure and pleasant \r\ntaste, and not to be destroyed even by the immortals. Formerly, the spirited and virtuous Krishna-Dwaipayana, by the \r\ninjunctions of Bhishma, the wise son of Ganga and of his own mother, became the father of three boys who were like the three \r\nfires by the two wives of Vichitra-virya; and having thus raised up Dhritarashtra, Pandu and Vidura, he returned to his recluse\r\nabode to prosecute his religious exercise.\r\nIt was not till after these were born, grown up, and departed on the supreme journey, that the great Rishi Vyasa published the \r\nBharata in this region of mankind; when being solicited by Janamejaya and thousands of Brahmanas, he instructed his disciple \r\nVaisampayana, who was seated near him; and he, sitting together with the Sadasyas, recited the Bharata, during the intervals of \r\nthe ceremonies of the sacrifice, being repeatedly urged to proceed.\r\nVyasa hath fully represented the greatness of the house of Kuru, the virtuous principles of Gandhari, the wisdom of Vidura, \r\nand the constancy of Kunti. The noble Rishi hath also described the divinity of Vasudeva, the rectitude of the sons of Pandu, \r\nand the evil practices of the sons and partisans of Dhritarashtra.\r\nVyasa executed the compilation of the Bharata, exclusive of the episodes originally in twenty-four thousand verses; and so \r\nmuch only is called by the learned as the Bharata. Afterwards, he composed an epitome in one hundred and fifty verses, \r\nconsisting of the introduction with the chapter of contents. This he first taught to his son Suka; and afterwards he gave it to \r\nothers of his disciples who were possessed of the same qualifications. After that he executed another compilation, consisting of\r\nsix hundred thousand verses. Of those, thirty hundred thousand are known in the world of the Devas; fifteen hundred thousand \r\nin the world of the Pitris: fourteen hundred thousand among the Gandharvas, and one hundred thousand in the regions of \r\nmankind. Narada recited them to the Devas, Devala to the Pitris, and Suka published them to the Gandharvas, Yakshas, and \r\nRakshasas: and in this world they were recited by Vaisampayana, one of the disciples of Vyasa, a man of just principles and the \r\nfirst among all those acquainted with the Vedas. Know that I, Sauti, have also repeated one hundred thousand verses.\r\nYudhishthira is a vast tree, formed of religion and virtue; Arjuna is its trunk; Bhimasena, its branches; the two sons of Madri \r\nare its full-grown fruit and flowers; and its roots are Krishna, Brahma, and the Brahmanas.\r\nPandu, after having subdued many countries by his wisdom and prowess, took up his abode with the Munis in a certain forest \r\nas a sportsman, where he brought upon himself a very severe misfortune for having killed a stag coupling with its mate, which \r\nserved as a warning for the conduct of the princes of his house as long as they lived. Their mothers, in order that the ordinances \r\nof the law might be fulfilled, admitted as substitutes to their embraces the gods Dharma, Vayu, Sakra, and the divinities the \r\ntwin Aswins. And when their offspring grew up, under the care of their two mothers, in the society of ascetics, in the midst of\r\nsacred groves and holy recluse-abodes of religious men, they were conducted by Rishis into the presence of Dhritarashtra and \r\nhis sons, following as students in the habit of Brahmacharis, having their hair tied in knots on their heads. 'These our pupils', \r\nsaid they, 'are as your sons, your brothers, and your friends; they are Pandavas.' Saying this, the Munis disappeared.",
